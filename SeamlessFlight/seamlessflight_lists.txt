SeamlessFlight - lists
-------------------------------------------------

SeamlessFlight officially is a "Fridays plugin", but has been
implemented in the night between Saturday and Sunday.

Also it has not been written from scratch but has been detached from a
 "fat server core plugin" to be an independent plugin.

Flying integrates with game play, using toggling sneak to control flying modes.

DOCS
------------------------------------------------

You can allow flying with turning it on with the /fly command,
 use "/fly" to toggle if flying can be used, or explicitly turn it on or off
 with "/fly on" and "/fly off", use tab completion for aliases.

You do not directly fly with flying enabled, in fact you can play normally and
 start flying by toggling sneak (see below).

Three speed modes are available:
* Hover (creative fly)
* Normal (cruise speed)
* Speed (fast)

In normal and speed modes you hold sneak to accelerate, 
 flying into the direction you are looking towards. 
Hover mode is just the standard creative flying.

Lift off and switching to a faster mode are done with hitting sneak twice
 but holding it down with the second hit.
Speed decrease is done with a short hit of sneak (no hold).

Normal lift off is with 2xsneak in normal mode (cruise speed).

There are specialties with hover mode:
* Hit sneak shortly (no hold) while falling and you switch to hover mode.
    Also works with multiple taps (regardles of hold).
* Hit sneak three or more times swiftly and hold to switch to hover mode
    for lift-off - however creative fly will go down with sneak, 
    so you need to switch to sprint (double-space usually),
    which can be tricky, but allows lift-off in hover mode directly,
    with a little practice.

Flying will be turned off if you are in creative mode, 
 the speed modes are not available. If you have creative mode,
 the player will be allowed to fly, which might conflict with plugins that
 allow creative mode but without flying.
 
Permissions:
* seamlessflight.fly.use: Use command + flying.
* seamlessflight.bypass.stop.flythrough: Fly through water, lava, ladders and similar.
* seamlessflight.bypass.stop.liftoff: Lift off from water, lava, ladders and similar.

MILESTONES
------------------------------------------------

*** Detect falling due to lag / etc.

*** Monitor flying speed (plshared probably).

*** Add better direct lift off in hover.

*** AntiCheat exemption use.

*** add events for start / end flying / changing speed (from to , FlyState + null).

*** Add permissions for use of different modes.

*** Add cost for flying: a) Food, b) money, c) items, d) combinations ??

*** Speeds configurable

*** Max height configurable (!) + similar to (temporary) permission loss

*** Implement configuration

*** NoCheatPlus exemption use.


STACK
------------------------------------------------

!remove violations more often (cruise, speed).

1.4 blocks !

?polling method: more efficient ?

!hover / on ground: more precise on-ground checks to allow flying / hovering at east 1/3 of a block above the ground, also for lift off in hover.

? more saving ?

more cleanup (adapt etc).

! more consistency for world changes / teleports -> at least force full re-check (perm + stop).
! world changes in moving events.
